// By default, Xcode tells Clang to complain about truncated integers. Rather than disabling that warning for the whole
// project, we guard #include <llvm/...> statements with these macros that disable them temporarily only.

// Xcode excludes header guard macros from autocompletion. For editing convenience, we don't use either
// SILENCE_LLVM_WARNINGS_* macro as a header guard.
